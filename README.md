# PrettyPrinny
Pretty Prinny is an effort to polish Disgaea PC back to the quality standards of the original console release. It draws on my extensive experience in OpenGL to fix some underlying problems that prevent the game from running at proper performance or image quality standards. Additionally, it touches on general usability issues such as input, and features to make modding easier on the community such as texture dumping and loading are planned.

Modding OpenGL software is a major chore, and nothing about this project is simple. My hope is that the time and effort spent here will pay dividends in future Disgaea releases and/or OpenGL-based games _(all two of them?)_ in general.

If you would like to donate, I have a Pledgie campaign dedicated to this project:
